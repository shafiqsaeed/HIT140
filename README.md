# Bats vs Rats: Investigation A (revisit) & Investigation B (seasonality)

This repository contains reproducible Python code and outputs for analysing batâ€“rat interactions using two datasets:
- `dataset1.csv`: bat landings during rat-present periods (behavioural annotations)
- `dataset2.csv`: 30-minute observation windows (rat minutes/arrivals, bat landings, food)

This project investigates how Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) adjust their foraging behaviour in response to black rats (Rattus rattus) under varying ecological contexts. Using two datasets collected from a semi-natural colony, we analysed over 7 months of nocturnal activity to evaluate avoidance, vigilance, and reward outcomes (Investigation A) and how these patterns shift seasonally (Investigation B). Statistical and visual analyses in Python reveal that bats exhibit greater vigilance and lower foraging success when rats are present, consistent with a predation-risk response rather than pure competition. Seasonal models further show that food scarcity and rat encounters amplify these effects. All analyses and figures/charts were generated reproducibly using Python.
